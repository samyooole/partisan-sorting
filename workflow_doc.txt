- get voter file data
[chunking MUST be done at each stage of the process]
- get universe of addresses, then geocode it (arcpy script?) with a local copy of pointaddresses (arcgis/esri) {to write this script today evening}
- join on addresses to get latlon
- keep track of address universe losses {particularly at the statistics stage} --> currently seems to be biased towards rural locations, which is definitely not ideal and i wanna try to minimize these losses {there is no better way already though, apart from maybe using google maps api, but that would be too expensive} [ inclusion of zip codes creates more problems....]


{

    without including zip codes: universe is 4193387 addresses

    --> bias of not including zip codes: leads to residents possibly being misidentified if they have the same address and same city but in different zip codes ?? <check how prevalent this is>

    {CONCLUSION: i don't think it's a huge issue. }
}

other issue: i don't have NCID ???????????????????????????? also try to parse these number fields as string first just in case
